        //BUT how can we make it know about the tree,
        //IF all that is passed to this class is dataContext, with is Entry?
        //Entry does not know about the VM.
        //THIS view does not know about anyother views, it is just a template.
        //It is handed a load of entries by the listBox...

        //WEll yes, but would have to just show them in the tree. Not very elegant.
        //ANOTHER way around it? 
        //LIKE making a ListBox that binds to Entries,
        //BUT you override the call that sets dataContext for each item,
        //AND instead, to pass them a Entry WRAPPED in a EntryVM?
        //MAYBE, but effort, AND maybe easier, and BETTER, to just add props
        //to the EntryVM.
        //IF do, back up before hand!

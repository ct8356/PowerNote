        //BUT then how does LTB get instantiated,
        //so that its dataContext is set to that of item, NOT the parentEntryVM???
        //YES tricky... SO maybe have to override a method here,
        //that MAKES the LTBlocks, and in it, it SETS the DataContext,
        //TO the a EntryVM that WRAPS property in the actual LIST!
